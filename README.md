## Project Objective: 
This project aims to conduct a comprehensive sales trend analysis for a coffee bean shop, focusing on identifying the most and least profitable products, detecting periods of increased and decreased sales on a weekly, monthly, and yearly scale, and determining the highest order volumes based on demographics and product preferences. 

## Dataset Involved:
The project is based on a set of data published on the Kaggle platform containing coffee information about customers, orders and offered products.<br>

## Key Insights:
#### Country-level 
- Poland has nearly 5,900 nurseries, but availability remains a challenge, with a significant portion of spots already occupied. 

- The cost of childcare varies widely, with monthly fees ranging from 0 zł to 4,000 zł, and notable regional disparities. 

- Only 43% of nurseries are adapted for children with disabilities, highlighting the need for improved accessibility. 

- Weekend childcare options are extremely limited, with just 72 nurseries open on Saturdays and 30 on Sundays. 

- A large majority (83%) of childcare facilities are traditional nurseries, while children's clubs make up only 17% of the sector.

#### Voivodeship-level 
- Mazowieckie, Śląskie, and Małopolskie have the highest nursery demand, yet their fees are among the highest—additional subsidies or expanded capacity could improve affordability and accessibility. 

- Zachodniopomorskie and Podkarpackie have the fewest nurseries adapted for disabled children, highlighting a need for better inclusion efforts and funding in these regions. 

- Lubuskie and Podkarpackie have the lowest nursery fees, but also fewer available spots, suggesting that increasing the number of nurseries in these areas could improve accessibility. 

- Meal costs significantly impact overall childcare expenses, especially when exceeding 18.26 zł per day-introducing meal subsidies or cost regulations could make nurseries more affordable. 

- Despite high subsidy rates in many voivodeships, nursery fees remain high in places like Małopolskie-evaluating the effectiveness of subsidies and adjusting funding distribution could better support families.
